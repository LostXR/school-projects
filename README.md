# school-projects

Collection of all projects from my Bachelor's and Master's studies at FIT BUT.

Majority of the projects were implemented in C and Python, but there are also
projects in C++, C#, Java, PHP, JavaScript, Assembly language, VHDL, Prolog,
and Haskell. LaTeX was used for documentation of some of the projects.

**Disclaimer:** These projects were done years ago, and not all
of them fully reflect all given specifications and
requirements. After all, these were all school projects -
you can inspire, but you should implement everything
by yourself.
